## Project Title: Analysis of Daily Stock Prices, News Impact, and Swing Trading Opportunities

### Objective:
The primary objective of this project is to analyze the effect of daily news on stock prices, focusing specifically on mid-cap stocks with a market capitalization between $2 billion and $10 billion. The project aims to determine the impact of news on stock price movements, assess the duration of the news effect, and explore swing trading opportunities. Additionally, the project will investigate the relationship between Reddit posts and news, determining whether news drives Reddit discussions or vice versa.

### Deliverables:

#### Data Pipeline Development:

Build a data pipeline that extracts historical news data, daily stock prices, and relevant Reddit posts. This will involve using APIs or web scraping techniques to gather and store the data.
The data will be processed and cleaned to ensure consistency and reliability, focusing exclusively on mid-cap stocks.

#### Time Series Analysis and Swing Trading:

Conduct a time series analysis using various AI models to predict stock price variances and categorize the likelihood of stock prices falling within specific price buckets.
Identify potential swing trading opportunities based on the analysis of news impact and stock price movements, with the aim of generating profit.
Develop strategies to leverage short-term price fluctuations influenced by news and social media trends.
